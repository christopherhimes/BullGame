# BullGame
Ever played Knights of the Old Republic, ever been in that Naga Shadow tomb. Well here is a super basic not that great text based version of it. 
Basically it is me playing around with moving between screens, creating inventory and record keeping, a barely functional d20 system, all set within that tomb. Oh and I tried to make a puzzle.
Just me seeing what works, how to do certain things within Python, and possibly creating a combat system for other projects.
